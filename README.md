Amondawa provides a ReST interface for storing and quering time series data.
It is inspired by KairosDB and openTSDB.  It is written to take advantage of
Amazon's AWS services - using dynamoDB as a backend store and packaged to run
atop Elastic Beanstalk.

The project is currently in an experimental phase and its performance has not
been characterized.
